        <h2 class="Goals"> Day 1?</h2>
        <p> So, for this I am going to start a blog type thing and use it
            as a way to document my journey. Today 1/22/22 is the day I delved into
            studying that <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/lecture/21915914#questions"> udemy
                course </a> on web dev I
            bought a bit ago
        </p>
        <p> As I learn new code I will update this page occasionally. Sort of like a progress tracker
        </p>

        <section id="Goals">
            <h3 class="Top"> Goals</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Be proficient in front end web skills</li>
                <li> Learn basic blockchain dev</li>
                <li> Create something valuable</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <div class="TIL">
            <h2> <a id="Things">Things I like</a></h2>

            <p> So Firstly I would like to add things I like to this page as to
                keep the personal aspect of it up. Here is a picture of a tiger (picture needs to be scaled down, it
                will be
                done with CSS): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1Lo5DPXgHE" target="_blank"><img class="Tiger"
                        src="https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/CEEJYohg9VZAqlqB4WEg0wTz4LA=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TAU2JU73A5HNVJO7IPO5J3XJOU.jpg"></a>

            <p> Now that I have a semi functional website, I will gladly be listing things I Like below in no
                particular
                order </p>
            <section>
                <div class="SW">
                    <p class="SWtxt"> STAR WARS</p>
                </div>

            </section>


        </div>
        </p>
        <section class="Prog">
            <h2 id="PT">
                Progress Tracker
            </h2>
            <p> Im not quite sure how to save versions of this project however I will save different files at 9 day
                intervals to see where it goes. So, this project will be advancements with Day 1-9 and detailing
                what I
                have
                learned</p>
            <p> All this I am aware of already Paragraphs, adding images, anchor tags, semantics, all that, and some
                basic
                CSS. However, the CSS will not be added yet.</p>
            <p> I have also found that I could add multiple Days and not take up much space in my computer, so I
                will be
                doing that.</p>
            <p> Here is a link to one of the new attributes I am starting named<a href="table.html"> table </a> </p>
            <p> Next, I will be making a <a href="forms.html"> form </a> this is day 2 1/24/22. The google form will
                not
                have the interactivity of JS
                but it will certainly be visually appealing, "visually appealing"</p>
            <p> Update: I added the CSS to the tiger. I added a hover effect, a different color theme, and a
                background
                image to the title. I would like to maybe add a menu, just cause it would be fun. 1/27/22</p>
            <h2 class="date"> 1/25/22</h2>
            <p> Today has mostly been playing around with the forms, its taken up majority of the time. I should be
                able to move on to css by tomorrow</p>

            <p>Completed the html pathway with final obstacle being this <a href="Race.html"> form</a> it did not
                take me too long but it was sort of repetetive and ended up stuck on one page. It doesnt go anywhere
                useful because I
                am not quite sure how to do that. I could only make it return to the main page since it is not finished.
                Tomorrow I will be start ing CSS and the week after that JS and hopefully move on to solidity.</p>
            <h2 class="date"> 1/26/22 </h2>
            <div>
                <p> So, today I learned CSS. Rather Refreshed my existing knowledge on CSS. The website is still very
                    basic
                    but it
                    is
                    inproving slowly. I hope to add text directly to the page with time, I haven't learned that yet.
                    I
                    have
                    also shrunk the image of the tiger which is exciting. I am not looking to center it which I
                    believe
                    can
                    be done if I insert it in to its own line. </p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="31"> 1/31/22 </h2>
            <div>
                <p> These past few days have been primarily messing around with the personal website. Looking into other
                    asepcts of cod, etc. I believe this to be my future career so I will act as so. Better in practice
                    as opposed to school and waste time. Im glad to live in an age that provides with such an
                    oppurtunity</p>
